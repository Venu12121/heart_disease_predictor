"Project Description: Heart Disease Prediction Model
Introduction
The heart disease prediction model is a machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on various medical and demographic features. This project utilizes historical patient data and leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to provide accurate predictions, potentially aiding in early detection and prevention of heart disease.

Data Collection and Preprocessing
The dataset used for this project was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, specifically the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, which is widely recognized in the medical and data science communities. The dataset includes 303 patient records with 14 features each, including:

Age: Age of the patient
Sex: Gender of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female)
CP: Chest pain type (0 to 3)
Trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
Chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
Fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
Restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (0 to 2)
Thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
Exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
Slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0 to 2)
Ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
Thal: Thalassemia (1 = normal, 2 = fixed defect, 3 = reversible defect)
Target: Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = presence, 0 = absence)
The first step in the project involved loading and cleaning the data. This included handling missing values by either filling them with appropriate statistics (mean, median, mode) or removing the incomplete records."
